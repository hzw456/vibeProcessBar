## Why Vibe Process Bar?

When using AI coding assistants like Cursor, Kiro, or Claude, do you often face these issues?

- 🤔 **Unknown Status** — AI is thinking in the background while you wait blindly
- ⏰ **Uncertain Completion** — Lose track of progress after switching windows
- 🔄 **Multi-task Chaos** — Easy to get confused when running multiple AI tasks
- 🪟 **Window Switching Pain** — Hard to find the right IDE window among many open apps

**Vibe Process Bar** solves these problems! It is a lightweight floating window that continuously stays on top, keeping you informed of the AI's working status at all times. **Double-click any task to instantly jump to its IDE window** — no more hunting through your taskbar!

> ⚠️ **Note**: On macOS, the window jump feature requires Accessibility permission (System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility). On Windows, it works out of the box.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### ⚠️ Prerequisites

**You MUST install the VS Code extension for Vibe Process Bar to work properly:**

👉 **[Vibe Process Bar VS Code Extension](https://github.com/hzw456/vibeProcessBarVSCodeExt)**

The desktop app communicates with the VS Code extension to detect AI coding activity. Without the extension, the progress bar will not function.

### Method 1: Download Pre-built Version (Recommended)

Download from the [Releases](https://github.com/hzw456/vibeProcessBar/releases) page:

| System | Download |
|:---|:---|
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `VibeProcessBar_x.x.x_aarch64.dmg` |
| macOS (Intel) | `VibeProcessBar_x.x.x_x64.dmg` |
| Windows (x64) | `VibeProcessbar_x.x.x_x64-setup.exe` or `.msi` |

### Method 2: Build from Source

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hzw456/vibeProcessBar.git
cd vibeProcessBar

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Run in development mode
npm run tauri dev

# 4. Build for production
npm run tauri build
# Alternatively on Windows: .\build-windows.ps1
```

> **For Windows users**, please refer to the [Windows Quick Start](WINDOWS_QUICK_START.md) and [Windows Build Guide](BUILD_WINDOWS.md) for more detailed instructions.

**System Requirements:**

## 🔌 Core Principles & Integration

Vibe Process Bar provides three flexible status detection mechanisms, adapting to different usage scenarios:

### 1️⃣ Hook Detection (Recommended)
Syncs status precisely via the IDE's own Hook mechanism.
- **Principle**: Uses IDE callbacks (like `.kirohooks` start scripts, `.cursorrules`, etc.) to automatically notify Vibe Process Bar when tasks start and end.
- **Supported Apps**: Cursor, Windsurf, Kiro, Trae, CodeBuddy, Antigravity.
- **Features**: Triggered by official or native Hook interfaces, extremely accurate.

**Hook Scripts Location**: `rules/on-agent-start.sh` and `rules/on-agent-complete.sh`

Copy these scripts to your IDE's hook configuration directory:
- **Kiro**: Copy to `.kiro/hooks/` directory
- **Cursor**: Reference in `.cursorrules` file
- **Other IDEs**: Follow their respective hook configuration methods

### 2️⃣ MCP Protocol (Recommended)
Connects directly via the Model Context Protocol standard.
- **Principle**: AI Agent actively connects to Vibe Process Bar Server via MCP Client.
- **Tools Provided**:
    - `list_tasks`: Get current active task list.
    - `update_task_status`: Report task status (running, completed, error, etc.).
- **Supported Apps**: Supports all plugins and tools compatible with MCP protocol (like Claude Desktop, Cline, RooCode, etc.).

**Important**: When using MCP, it's recommended to also use the rules in `rules/rules.md` to ensure the AI Agent properly reports status. Add the content of `rules/rules.md` to your AI assistant's system prompt or rules configuration.

**Configuration Example**:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vibe-process-bar": {
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:31415/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### 3️⃣ Plugin Reporting (Code Detection)
Analyzes code change frequency via VS Code extension.
- **Principle**: Monitors file modification speed and character changes to infer if AI is generating code.
- **Supported Plugins**: GitHub Copilot, RooCode, Cline, Claude Code, and all other AI plugins running inside VS Code.

**⚠️ Required**: You must install the [Vibe Process Bar VS Code Extension](https://github.com/hzw456/vibeProcessBarVSCodeExt) to enable this feature.

> [!WARNING]
> **Not recommended for precise tracking**
> This method is a "guess" based on code modification behavior, which is less accurate than MCP or Hook methods. Only recommended as a supplement when MCP or Hook cannot be used.
