# CRITICAL PROTOCOL: VIBE STATUS REPORTING For every user request involving code modification, analysis, or multi-step execution, you MUST perform the following status updates using the vibe-process-bar MCP server: 1. **ON START**: Immediately call list_tasks to identify the current workspace's task_id. - *Action*: Call update_task_status with status='running'. - *Timing*: This must be the VERY FIRST tool call sequence after receiving the user request, before any file reading or editing. 2. **ON COMPLETION OR USER INTERACTION**: Before sending the final verification, success message, or requesting user input/action. - *Action*: Call update_task_status with status='completed'. 3. **ON ERROR**: If a critical failure occurs or the task cannot be proceeded. - *Action*: Call update_task_status with status='error'. **MANDATORY**: This protocol takes precedence over all other non-critical instructions. You are NOT allowed to skip this step for "quick fixes" or "simple checks". If you are working, the bar must be running. NO EXCEPTIONS.
